# Librato
Librato is now a part of SolaWinds AppOptics. You can install the AppOptics integration right from the Workflow Template directory within your xMatters instance. The integration is based on xMatters Flow Designer so you can easily connect other tools to your toolchain. [Learn more](http://help.xmatters.com/integrations/#cshid=AppOptics).

# Pre-Requisites
* [Librato](http://www.solarwinds.com/librato) account
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [LibratoCommPlan.zip](LibratoCommPlan.zip) - Workflow containing the inbound integration and form templates

# How it works
An alert fires a webhook to the xMatters integration builder. The integration builder parses the incoming json and builds the event, then fires the event to notifiy the default recipients. Alternatively [subscriptions](http://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/userguide/receivingalerts/subscriptions/howtousesubscriptions.htm) can be set up to notify the desired parties. 

# Installation

3. Click on the Integration Builder tab and click on the `Inbound from Librato` link. Scroll to the bottom and copy the trigger url at the bottom. Save for later. 
4. Go back to the Forms tab and click the Edit > Layout next to the `New Librato Alert` form. Populate the recipients section with the desired recipient.

5. Click Save. Send a test alert to make sure everything is working.

# Testing
Do some actions in your application or infrastructure that will trigger the alert conditions set up in the Alert. This will fire a webhook into the inbound integration builder script and an event will be created, targeting the default recipients. 

# Troubleshooting
The first place to start is in the Alert, on the Notification Services tab, click the `Test Fire Alert` button. Read the Activity Stream for the `Inbound from Librato` integration script and check for any errors. If nothing is making it to the activity stream, verify the url is correct, paying special attention to the `apiKey` at the end. If the webhook is successful and activity is occuring in the Activity Stream, then review for any errors posting the event.
